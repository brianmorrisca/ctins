		<p>Segregated funds are similar to mutual funds, but with additional benefits. They can allow you to pursue your investment goals while protecting the money you invest with special features and guarantees.</p>

		<p>Segregated funds cover all asset classes and investment styles, and can be held in non-registered accounts or within registered plans such as RRSPs, RRIFs and Tax Free Savings Accounts. You can keep equities in your segregated fund portfolio to help meet your investment goals, knowing that your principal is protected with the maturity guarantee.</p>

		<p>The death benefit guarantee ensures that your principal investment is passed to your beneficiary.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Maturity guarantee</strong>: When you hold your investment until maturity, often 10 years, the minimum value is guaranteed to be 75% and may be up to as much as 100% or more of your initial investment.</li>
			<li><strong>Death benefit guarantee</strong>: Upon the investorâ€™s death, the beneficiary is guaranteed to receive a minimum of 75% and may be up to as much as 100% or more of the value of the initial investment.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Segregated funds can be an ideal investment choice. You can take advantage of other special features and advantages such as:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Locked-in investment gains</strong>: You can periodically lock in your gains with a reset option, increasing your maturity and death benefit guarantees.</li>
			<li><strong>Creditor protection</strong>: Your personal investments may be protected from creditors in the unforeseen event of bankruptcy.</li>
			<li><strong>Tax benefits</strong>: Net capital losses can be claimed by the investor to offset taxable capital gains.</li>
			<li><strong>Bypass probate</strong>: Segregated funds can pass directly to the named beneficiary outside the estate. Probate fees are avoided, and the proceeds are transferred privately.</li>
		</ul>
