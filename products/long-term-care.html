		<p>If you ever lose the ability to take care of yourself and need assistance at home or in a long-term care facility, how will you pay for the costs? Long Term Care insurance helps with the costs of personal care when illnesses or failing health prevent you from caring for yourself.</p>

		<p>Canadians are living longer, which increases the chance that at some point you will require help to take care of yourself.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is estimated that over 40% of people over age 65 will spend time in a long term care facility<sup>1</sup>.</li>
			<li>For couples over age 65, there is a two out of three chance that at least one of them will require facility care<sup>2</sup>.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Long term care facilities are expensive and can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars per year, even in government-subsidized facilities. Home care is equally expensive.</p>

You have peace of mind that you are not burdening your loved ones. Benefits are provided should you require assistance with at least two of the six activities of daily living:</p>
		<ul>

			<li>Dressing</li>
			<li>Toileting</li>
			<li>Eating</li>
			<li>Transferring</li>
			<li>Maintaining continence</li>
		</ul>
