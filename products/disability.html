		<h1>Protecting Your Income During Disability</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<p>If an illness or injury prevented you from working for several months or more, how would you cope financially? You may have Disability coverage from your employer, but is the protection adequate? If you are self employed, how would you pay your bills if you couldnâ€™t run your business? Disability insurance provides a monthly benefit to replace income lost due to illness or injury.</p>

		<p>It is estimated that more than 40% of all Canadians will suffer a disability that lasts for at least 90 days during their working years<sup>1</sup>. The average disability lasts almost three years<sup>2</sup>. Most disabilities result from injuries caused by accidents, psychological illnesses, cancer, heart disease and musculoskeletal conditions<sup>3</sup>.</p>

		<p>Disability insurance protects a percentage of lost income if you become disabled. When you purchase your own coverage, the benefits are tax-free so they may represent a substantial part of your usual takehome pay. If you have group disability coverage through your employer, it may have restrictions on the type of disability, amount of coverage or the amount of time benefits will be paid. Individual Disability insurance can be tailored to meet your specific needs.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Choose the number of years your benefits will continue and how long you wait after a disability until the first payment is received.</li>
			<li>Choose the definition of disability; are you considered disabled if you cannot perform your &quot;own occupation&quot;, your &quot;regular occupation&quot; or &quot;any occupation.&quot;</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Disability insurance can offer additional optional features to enhance your policy:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Partial disability option</strong> can pay a percentage of the usual benefit if you can work at a reduced level.</li>
			<li><strong>Retirement savings protection</strong> makes regular payments on your behalf to a retirement investment account during your disability.</li>
			<li><strong>Waiver of premium</strong> will maintain your coverage during disability without needing to pay premiums.</li>
			<li><strong>Refund of premiums</strong> allows all or a portion of your premiums to be refunded at specified periods dependent on your claim history.</li>
			<li><strong>Cost of living adjustment</strong> provides the option to increase your benefit payments to keep up to inflation.</li>
			<li><strong>Future income option</strong> allows you to increase your coverage in the future despite changes to your health.</li>
		</ul>
