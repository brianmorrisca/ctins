		<h1>Attract and Retain Quality Staff</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<p>To succeed in today’s marketplace, you not only compete to gain market share – you compete to recruit the best employees. That makes a group benefit program for staff especially important. You can attract quality personnel, retain your staff and keep them motivated.</p>

		<p>Implementing a group benefit program is an excellent way to show your staff that you appreciate their efforts. Equally important, you get back what you give, through increased productivity and a more successful operation.</p>

		<p>You can provide valuable group life and health benefits for your staff, regardless of the size of your company – even if you have only two or three employees. Depending on the provider, you can either choose a set program or customize a plan for your company. Following are the common benefits for you to consider:</p>

		<h3>Life Insurance</h3>
		<p>Life insurance protects an employee’s beneficiary in the event of the employee’s death. Coverage may be a set insurance amount or a multiple of the employee’s annual salary.</p>

		<p>A Dependent Life insurance benefit makes the employee the beneficiary in the event of a spouse or dependent child’s death.</p>

		<p>Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance covers the consequences of an accident, including but not limited to death, loss of limb, paralysis, and loss of hearing, sight or speech.</p>

		<h3>Disability Insurance</h3>
		<p>Long Term Disability insurance replaces a percentage of income if an employee cannot work for an extended period due to an illness or injury. Short Term Disability covers employees who are unable to work for a temporary period. Many providers offer resources and support to help employees on disability return to work sooner.</p>

		<h3>Critical Illness Insurance</h3>
		<p>Critical Illness insurance helps protect an employee’s health and financial situation when diagnosed with a serious illness or medical condition such as cancer, stroke or heart attack.</p>

		<h3>Dental Insurance</h3>
		<p>Dental insurance covers common preventative care such as checkups and cleanings, and restorative services such as fillings and crowns. Plan options may also cover oral surgery, orthodontics and other dental treatments.</p>

		<h3>Extended Health Care Insurance</h3>
		<p>Extended Health Care insurance covers medical expenses not covered by provincial plans, commonly including vision care, hospital rooms and registered specialists such as chiropractors and physiotherapists. Prescription drug coverage is often included under this benefit. Travel medical coverage may be included or offered separately.</p>

		<h3>Employee Assistance Program</h3>
		<p>This valuable program provides confidential counseling services to your employees and their families when they need professional assistance dealing with personal, family or work related issues.</p>

		<h3>Health Spending Account</h3>
		<p>The Health Spending Account allows for an annual amount to reimburse employees for a wide range of medical services and health-related expenses not covered elsewhere under the basic plan.</p>

		<h3>How Group Benefits Help Your Company</h3>
		<p>When you offer a group benefit program, you demonstrate to staff that you care about their health and welfare, and you strengthen your business.</p>
		<p>Here are the key ways a group life and health plan can help your company:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Attract high-quality employees – many qualified candidates only pursue jobs that have a benefit program</li>
			<li>Boost morale and increase company loyalty</li>
			<li>Retain good people who appreciate management caring about staff</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>A Program that Makes Business Sense</h3>
		<p>Bringing a benefits program to your workplace also gives your business a healthier bottom line:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Attracting talented staff translates into a more successful operation and increased revenue</li>
			<li>Higher morale results in improved productivity</li>
			<li>Retaining your qualified people minimizes the costs associated with staff turnover and training</li>
			<li>For a corporation, group benefit premiums are generally tax-deductible as a business expense</li>
		</ul>
