		<h1>Enhanced Retirement Income for Business Owners</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<p>Many executives employed by large corporations benefit from pension plans or retirement packages to make life more comfortable during the retirement years. As a small business owner, you also have programs available to help you fulfill your retirement goals. You can also offer these retirement programs to your senior executives, to attract and retain valuable staff key to your company’s success.</p>

		<p>When it comes to saving for retirement, your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) alone may not meet all your needs. You can use nonregistered investments to help fund retirement, but as a business owner there are additional taxadvantaged solutions available.</p>

		<p>Here are three business owner retirement income programs you should consider:</p>
		<h3>Corporate Insured Retirement Program</h3>
		<p>A Corporate Insured Retirement Program is a strategy that meets two separate needs – insurance protection for the business and supplementary retirement income for the business owner. The strategy uses tax-exempt life insurance, such as Universal Life insurance, which has an insurance and investment component.</p>

		<p>The insurance may be purchased for any business need, such as covering a capital gains tax liability. Deposits to the investment component grow on a taxdeferred basis and become the basis for retirement income. At retirement, the policy value is used to secure a series of tax-free loans to supplement retirement income. When you pass away, the insurance policy’s death benefit covers the loans and interest.</p>

		<h3>Individual Pension Plan (IPP)</h3>
		<p>An Individual Pension Plan (IPP) is a defined benefit pension plan registered with Canada Revenue Agency, which replaces your RRSP. Investments are managed through an insurance company or pension trust. Like an RRSP, an IPP offers tax-deferred growth, but allows larger annual contributions and guarantees a fixed pension amount.</p>
		<p>Another key benefit is that the corporation typically makes a significant and immediate contribution recognizing an individual’s years of past service. Annual contributions, the past service contribution and plan expenses are tax-deductible to the company.</p>

		<h3>Retirement Compensation Arrangement (RCA)</h3>
		<p>A Retirement Compensation Arrangement (RCA) is a non-registered plan where the company makes taxdeductible contributions that will become retirement benefit payments supplementing RRSP and pension payments. Funds can be held in a variety of investments – using tax-exempt life insurance as the investment vehicle enables all savings and earnings to remain in the RCA and grow tax-deferred. The RCA is designed so that RCA and registered plan payments combine for a total annual amount equal to 70% of your annual pre-retirement income.</p>

		<h2>Retirement Compensation for Executives</h2>
		<p>The Corporate Insured Retirement Program, Individual Pension Plan (IPP) and Retirement Compensation Arrangement (RCA) can be used for a business owner or executive.</p>
		<p>Offering one of these retirement plans to a valuable executive is an excellent way to help ensure longterm loyalty to the company.</p>
		<p>Typically, the company funds these solutions, though situations exist where employees share the contributions. In solutions involving life insurance, this is sometimes called a split dollar arrangement, where two parties fund the policy for two purposes. Executive retirement solutions are advanced strategies, and broader consideration needs to be taken into account. Make sure to speak to your insurance representative for more information.</p>
