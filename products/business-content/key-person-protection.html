		<h1>Protect Your Business from the Loss of a Key Person</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<p>In your company, you likely have one or more people with the experience or expertise that make them key to the operation. If you lost the services of such a key person, permanently or temporarily, the success and profitability of your business could be at risk. Key person insurance can protect your business from the financial impact of losing a key person’s services due to disability, critical illness or premature death.</p>

		<p>The most important asset for most companies is the people, and you probably have one or more individuals who qualify as a key person. A key person is someone who is essential to your company’s success and who would be difficult to replace.</p>

		<p>Examples of key people include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Business owner who remains critical to the company’s success</li>
			<li>Sales manager or sales professional who expands sales and brings in new business</li>
			<li>Managing director or executive responsible for day-to-day operations</li>
			<li>Person whose reputation and connections attract customers or capital</li>
			<li>Engineering, technology or product development specialist</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Protection Against Business Disruption and Lost Revenue</h3>
		<p>When a company loses the services of a key person, the impact on the business is usually significant and immediate.</p>
		<p>Consider the ways your business may suffer if you lose the services of a key person:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Decreased revenue from business disruption, reduced sales and key customers taking their business elsewhere</li>
			<li>Financial duress from creditors restricting credit and suppliers tightening payment terms</li>
			<li>Lost productivity and recruitment costs while trying to find an individual possessing similar skills and experience</li>
			<li>Continued lower productivity during the period the replacement is learning your operation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Three Types of Key Person Protection</h3>
		<p>Life insurance is usually the cornerstone of key person coverage, with Disability insurance and Critical Illness insurance providing your business with comprehensive protection.</p>

		<p><strong>Life insurance</strong> - The tax-free death benefit acts as a reserve to make up for decreases in revenue during the transition period. The amount can also repay debts, cover regular business expenses, and pay for temporary help and recruitment costs.</p>

		<p><strong>Disability insurance</strong> - The business is both the owner and beneficiary of a disability insurance policy on a key person. If the covered individual cannot work due to illness or injury, benefits support the company financially while you secure a replacement.</p>

		<p><strong>Critical Illness insurance</strong> - A key person who has a heart attack, stroke, cancer or other covered condition may not be able to work temporarily or permanently, or experience reduced productivity. The company, as policy owner and beneficiary, receives a lump sum payment for financial protection.</p>

		<h2>Additional Business Protection for Owners</h2>
		<h3>Business Loan Protection</h3>
		<p>Creditors providing business loans may require a business owner to personally guarantee a loan for protection against the owner’s death. A solution is collateral life insurance on the loan amount that the business purchases on the life of the owner.</p>
		<p>In addition, a business owner may have the business purchase insurance on their life to cover loans and debts even when not required by creditors. This coverage protects the business and the owner’s heirs in the event of the owner’s death.</p>

		<h3>Business Overhead Protection</h3>
		<p>A form of Disability insurance, Business Overhead Protection provides financial assistance to keep the business going if the owner suffers an illness or injury and cannot work. The monthly benefit reimburses eligible business overhead expenses during the disability, including staff salaries, rent or mortgage interest, utilities and other fixed monthly expenses.</p>

		<p>With this coverage, an owner can focus on their own health, knowing the business will remain operational and valued staff will stay with the company.</p>
