		<h1>The Types of Life Insurance</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<p>There are two main types of life insurance â€“ term life insurance and permanent life insurance. With permanent insurance, beneficiaries typically receive the insurance amount upon the death of the insured. Term insurance pays the insurance amount to beneficiaries if the insured dies within the term of coverage.</p>

		<h2>Term life insurance</h2>
		<p>Term insurance is purchased for a specified term, for example 10 or 20 years, and offers guaranteed premiums for the duration of term. At the end of the term, you can renew coverage or convert to permanent insurance. Term insurance can be an affordable way to purchase coverage for temporary needs, especially at younger ages.</p>

		<h2>Permanent life insurance</h2>
		<p>&quot;Permanent insurance&quot; is an umbrella term that represents several products, all of which provide coverage that lasts a lifetime:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Term to 100 insurance provides lifetime protection and level premiums guaranteed for life.</li>
			<li>Whole Life insurance and Universal Life insurance combine insurance coverage with a tax-advantaged investment component. The investment component can grow free of accrual taxation within the policy up to specified thresholds.
				<ul>
					<li>Whole Life insurance offers level premiums and an investment component professionally managed by the insurance company.</li>
					<li>Universal Life insurance can offer flexibility in the premium amounts you pay and provides investment options of your choice.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
