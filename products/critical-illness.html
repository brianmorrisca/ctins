		<p>If you suffer a critical illness such as a heart attack, cancer or stroke, wouldn’t you like the ability to afford the best treatment available and to take as much time as you would like to recuperate? Critical Illness insurance provides a solution to help you cope financially while you recuperate by providing a lump sum benefit to use however you wish.</p>

		<p>Do you know someone who has suffered a critical illness? It is estimated that almost one in four Canadians will contract heart disease<sup>1</sup> and one in three will develop some form of cancer<sup>2</sup>. Thankfully, with medical advancements in modern technology, most will survive<sup>3</sup>.</p>

		<p>Critical Illness insurance pays a significant lump sum, tax-free benefit to you if you are diagnosed with a condition covered in your policy and survive 30 days after diagnosis. You can choose coverage from $25,000 up to $2 million and use the benefits however you wish:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Go out of the country for medical treatment or pay for private nursing.</li>
			<li>Modify your home or move to a home more appropriate for your condition.</li>
			<li>Stay home longer before returning to work.</li>
			<li>Allow a family member to take a leave from work to help you recover.</li>
			<li>Pay off your mortgage and bills, or even retire early.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Critical Illness insurance can offer additional optional features to enhance your policy:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Return of Premium at Surrender will <strong>reimburse your premiums</strong> if you are not diagnosed with a critical illness after a certain period of time, usually 15 years or at a specified age.</li>
			<li>Return of Premium at Death will refund premiums paid to your estate or named beneficiary if you pass away without becoming eligible for the insurance benefit.</li>
			<li>Children’s Critical Illness riders can provide insurance for all of your children under a certain age with one small additional premium.</li>
		</ul>
