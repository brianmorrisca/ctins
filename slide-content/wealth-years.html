		<h1>The Income and Wealth Transfer Years</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<p>When you reach retirement, your financial plan changes from 
		wealth accumulation to income generation. The nature of your 
		family obligations likely change as well. Where you once focused 
		on raising your children, they may now be the focus of your estate 
		planning. You may also have the added obligation to look after 
		your parents as they age, and you must plan for your own care 
		too.</p>
		<p>It’s a time of your life when you find out about a new set of financial management strategies and vehicles designed for retirement income and leaving a legacy. Financial planning advice is important. You need to preserve assets, reduce risk and ensure that your income level will sustain your retirement lifestyle for your lifetime.</p>
		<h3>Estate Planning</h3>
		<p><strong>Life Insurance</strong>: Permanent life insurance can be used for a variety of estate planning needs:</p>
		<ul class="boxshadow">
			<li>You can create a tax-free inheritance</li>
			<li>Heirs can use proceeds to offset the estate’s tax liability</li>
			<li>You can equalize your estate among heirs, leaving property or a business to one child and insurance proceeds to another</li>
			<li>You can name a charity as beneficiary and receive significant tax advantages</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Health Protection</h3>
		<p><strong>Long Term Care Insurance</strong>: If illness or failing health prevents you from caring for yourself, you may need to move to a long tem care facility or receive comprehensive care at home. But high costs, not covered by government benefits, could be unaffordable or deplete your assets. Long Term Care insurance can help cover the costs of home care or a long term care residence with tax-free benefits.</p>
		
		<h3>Income and Investments</h3>
		<p><strong>Segregated Funds</strong>: Segregated funds are similar to mutual funds, but they offer principal protection, the ability to lock in investment gains and potential creditor protection. They also provide estate planning benefits, as the assets bypass the will when they go to heirs: probate and estate fees on those assets are eliminated, extended delays are avoided and the assets are transferred privately.</p>
		<p><strong>Tax-Advantaged Investing with Permanent Life Insurance</strong>: Whole Life and Universal Life insurance combine permanent life insurance with a tax-advantaged savings component. The savings component in Whole Life insurance is professionally managed by the insurance company. With Universal Life insurance you can choose your own investment funds from all asset classes, including accounts providing guaranteed returns. Your investments grow tax-sheltered and beneficiaries receive insurance and investment amounts tax-free. This vehicle can also be used for retirement income or charitable giving.</p>

		<p><strong>Annuities and Insured Annuities</strong>: A Life Annuity provides a stream of income payments in return for a lump sum deposit. An annuity is usually selected because payments are greater than GIC income and last for life. An annuity can also be combined with life insurance – called an Insured Annuity. A portion of your annuity income pays the premiums on a life insurance policy, and beneficiaries receive an amount equal to the lump sum that purchased the annuity.</p>

		<p><strong>Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit Product</strong>: The Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit Product provides retirement income that can be guaranteed, even if markets fall. You invest in segregated funds and can receive income for life, with the potential for your income to increase. If you choose to invest before retirement, you receive a bonus, commonly 5%, in each year you don’t withdraw funds – even in years of a market downturn.</p>
