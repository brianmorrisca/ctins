		<p>When you reach retirement, your financial plan changes from 
		wealth accumulation to income generation. The nature of your 
		family obligations likely change as well. Where you once focused 
		on raising your children, they may now be the focus of your estate 
		planning. You may also have the added obligation to look after 
		your parents as they age, and you must plan for your own care 
		too.</p>
		<p>Each situation is unique, but here are some future needs commonly covered when you protect your family’s income:</p>
		<ul class="boxshadow">
			<li>Maintain the family’s standard of living</li>
			<li>Pay final expenses such as funeral costs, taxes and estate fees</li>
			<li>Enable your family to remain in the family home</li>
			<li>Provide for your children’s childcare expenses, summer camp, vacations and education until they have completed school and are self-supporting</li>
			<li>Leave a legacy for your heirs</li>
		</ul>
