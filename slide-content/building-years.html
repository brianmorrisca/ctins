		<h1>The Building Years</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<p>In the building years, you are starting out on your financial plan. 
		You may have young children. Your family income enables you 
		to begin accumulating assets, and you are likely contributing to 
		an RRSP, perhaps a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) and/or 
		an RESP. However, cash flow may be tight and you likely have 
		significant short and long term debt, particularly a mortgage.</p>
		<p>This is the time of your life when risks to your family’s financial 
		security are the greatest. You don’t have the assets to support 
		the family over time if a main income earner falls sick for a 
		prolonged period and can’t work, or passes away prematurely. 
		Protecting your family’s financial security is essential.</p>

		<h2>Income Protection</h2>
		<p><strong>Life Insurance</strong>: One of the most important decisions you can make is to safeguard your family’s financial security. When you choose life insurance, you protect your family’s income now and for the future. If you should pass away prematurely, the insurance benefit creates an instant estate. Your family can maintain their standard of living and achieve their goals in life.</p>

		<h2>Health Protection</h2>
		<p><strong>Disability Insurance</strong>: Disability insurance pays a monthly benefit to help replace lost income if you cannot work due to a sickness or injury. It’s especially important if you are self-employed, as a disability could be financially devastating. If you are an employee with group coverage, you could still need personal Disability insurance to 
		cover areas where the group plan may be lacking.</p>

		<p><strong>Critical Illness Insurance</strong>: If you are diagnosed with cancer or suffer a heart attack or other serious medical condition, Critical Illness insurance provides a tax-free lump sum benefit to cover associated costs. You can use the benefit for out-of-country treatment, home nursing care, to cover an extended recuperation period or in any way you wish.</p>

		<h2>Investments</h2>
		<p><strong>Segregated Funds</strong>: Segregated funds are similar to mutual funds, but they offer principal protection, the ability to lock in investment gains, potential creditor protection and estate planning benefits. They can suit conservative investors who will only choose equities if they receive a degree of principal protection to minimize the risk of market volatility.</p>

		<h3>Jason and Sandra</h3>
		<p>Jason and Sandra are in their mid-30s, married, with two pre-schoolers. Jason is manager of a large retail operation and receives group life and health benefits; Sandra is a stay-at-home parent.</p>
		<img class="profile rounded-corners boxshadow" src="../img/slide-building-years-content-1.jpg" width="200" height="200" >
		<p><strong>Income Protection</strong>: Jason’s group life coverage would pay for final expenses (e.g. funeral expenses etc.) and help cover existing debt but not provide for the family’s future. He and Sandra each purchase 20-year term insurance to protect the family until their children complete their education.</p>
		<p><strong>Health Protection</strong>: Sandra is not eligible for Disability insurance as she is not working. She purchases Critical Illness insurance, thinking especially about caregiver costs for the children if she should suffer a critical illness. Jason’s group plan pays disability benefits for a maximum of 24 months. To better protect himself and his family, Jason tops up his existing coverage with personal Disability insurance that pays benefits until age 65.</p>

		<h3>Emily</h3>
		<p>Emily, 34, is a single parent with a 6-year-old son. She works as a librarian.</p>
		<img class="profile rounded-corners boxshadow" src="../img/slide-building-years-content-2.jpg" width="200" height="200" >
		<p><strong>Income Protection</strong>: Emily chooses permanent life insurance because she intends to use insurance to leave money for her son; she makes the purchase now to lock in favourable premium costs while she is healthy. She adds a 20-year Term insurance rider to boost coverage cost-effectively during her son’s childhood.</p>
		<p><strong>Health Protection</strong>: She has Disability insurance through her employer’s group plan. As a single parent, Emily also purchases Critical Illness insurance to cover every contingency; she chooses the Return of Premium option that pays back her premiums at a future date if she hasn’t made a claim.</p>
		<p><strong>Investments</strong>: Emily recognizes that she should include equities in her investment portfolio to gain the returns she wants for her nest egg, but she has held only fixed income funds because of her cautious nature and worries over market volatility. She decides to begin	investing in segregated funds, including solid holdings in equities, with peace of mind knowing her principal is guaranteed.</p>
