		<h1>Protect Your Family's Income</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<p>Imagine what your family’s life would be like if their main source of income was suddenly gone. That’s why purchasing life insurance is so crucial to securing your family’s future. You can protect their standard of living and make sure that each member of your family still achieves their goals in life.</p>
		<p>Some people delay the decision to get life insurance, but it’s important to purchase coverage while you’re still healthy. Otherwise, if you develop a serious medical condition you could pay significantly higher premiums or even be denied coverage.</p>
		<p>Each situation is unique, but here are some future needs commonly covered when you protect your family’s income:</p>
		<ul class="boxshadow">
			<li>Maintain the family’s standard of living</li>
			<li>Pay final expenses such as funeral costs, taxes and estate fees</li>
			<li>Enable your family to remain in the family home</li>
			<li>Provide for your children’s childcare expenses, summer camp, vacations and education until they have completed school and are self-supporting</li>
			<li>Leave a legacy for your heirs</li>
		</ul>
